Title: About Me

I am a character rigger, passionate about video games and especially their narrative potential as an interactive medium.

I studied Computer Graphics at Bellecour School with the original goal of becoming a character artist.  
After graduating and landing my first job, I quickly transition to rigging and tools development.  
About two years after that I left my Job at SuperProd to make my way in the gaming industry. I went through one of Rigging Dojo's apprenticeship which helped me push my rigging skills to the next level.

During my free time, I work as the Lead character TD on Project Borealis. A volunteer project bringing talented and passionate people together to make the the long awaited 3rd episode of the Half-Life 2 episodic trilogy.
